Curious George, A Peeling Monkey: George really can\\x92t wait to see what\\x92s inside Professor Wiseman\\x92s birthday present. Because he\\x92s a good little monkey, he leaves the present in one piece, but he distracts himself by \"unwrapping\" everything else around him.

So he experiments with being a cat and a pigeon but decides that the best of all is to be a dog like Hundley. Hundley is not at all happy with this plan but doesn\\x92t manage to convince George that there\\x92s room for only one lobby dog at this apartment building.

       "   'longDescription': \"A Bridge too Farm: When George sees six stranded chicks on an island in a pond it's monkey to the rescue! George tries out several plans. Floating on his back as a monkey life raft is only temporarily successful so George looks for design inspiration in the local railroad and truss bridges. Using marshmallows, toothpicks and playing cards George constructs and then reconstructs a bridge strong enough to support one, then two, and then all six loud peeping chicks - and even the Mother Hen! Monkey Fever: The Man with the Yellow Hat always takes such good care of George, so when the Man comes down with a terrible case of the sniffles, George wants to return the favor. But how? He decides to try his own brand of monkey medicine to nurse the Man back to health, including setting up the bedroom like a real hospital, feeding the Man's cold and starving his fever, and even playing an impromptu game of charades with the pharmacist to get the proper cold medicine. But as George plays doctor for a day, he notices that the Man's symptoms are peculiarly close to those of Betsy's cat, the new mother of five kittens. Could the Man's illness mean he's anticipating feline fatherhood?\"},\n",

Professor Wiseman has enlisted the pair to help find the nesting grounds of the Chinstrap penguins. Equipped with a video camera, two-way headsets, and a photo of the penguins, our two explorers set out in different directions. George meets a Chinstrap penguin, only to lose his camera to a pesky sea otter who swims away. The Man finds George, and they chase the sea otter by jumping ice floes...and discover too late that a blizzard is approaching! George and the Man find refuge in a cave. When the blizzard passes, they emerge on the other side of the island in the middle of the Chinstrap penguins' nesting ground! The Perfect Carrot: George and Bill run out of carrots while feeding the rabbits. When Bill pulls a carrot out of the ground, George can't believe it! George wants to grow his own carrots. Armed with a packet of carrot seeds, and guidance from the Man with the Yellow Hat, George plants his garden. After 66 days of tending, watering and keeping Jumpy away, George has a prize-winning carrot! It's so perfect in size, shape, and color, that George carries it around in a fancy telescope case to protect it. George visits Bill's house to show it off, and he learns that the bunnies have gone missing! George joins the search and finds them hungry and scared in a cave. It's a hard decision to make, but George sacrifices his perfect carrot for the bunnies to eat while he finds help.\"},\n",

       "   'longDescription': 'Mulch Ado About Nothing: The secret to Bill\\'s amazing garden is the compost he uses to feed his plants. George decides to make compost for his hungry plants...so George empties the entire contents of his fridge in the backyard. The next morning, George realizes that instead of making plant food, he\\'s made a stinky mess! The Renkins teach George that proper compost consists of dirt, water, and air with only certain foods (no meat or dairy). Back at the apartment in the city, George sees that all the plants need food. George prepares a hearty \"meal\" ...using every container that he can find. When the Man with the Yellow Hat wakes up to an unusual smell, he follows his nose to the compost! To the neighbors\\' delight, George made enough for all the plants in the building. What Goes Up: It\\'s \"Reuse Your Junk Day\" and George and the Man with the Yellow Hat have one last pickup before they go to the lake. But when they arrive at Renkins\\' Farm, they find a mountain of junk piled in the Renkins\\' living room. There\\'s no way they\\'ll finish the job before the suns goes down, which means no lake for George. While the Man is taking a load to the collection center, George discovers that he can use the ironing board as a lever to launch the junk out of the living room and onto the front yard. Soon, all the pigs, chickens, and squirrels are ducking for cover! George\\'s ingenious invention got all the junk outside, but it\\'s scattered everywhere! Did this little monkey cause more work for himself?'}]}"
